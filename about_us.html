<p class="Body-P"><span class="Body-C">About Us</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The Furniture Trades Provident and Benevolent Association (later renamed the Furniture
    Trades Benevolent Association) was formed in 1903. One of its first actions was to
    establish a Cottage Village and Orphanage at Cobden Hill, Radlett, Hertfordshire
    to &#39;</span><span class="Normal-C-C0">maintain and educate the orphan and necessitous children</span><span class="Normal-C">&#39; of its members. The
    establishment was formerly opened on 22</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">nd</span><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;July, 1905, by the Association&#39;s President,
    Samuel James Waring (later to become the 1</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">st</span><span class="Normal-C"> Baron Waring) and comprised of two pairs
    of semi-<wbr>detached houses. In 1918, a third house was built, and in 1921 the Home relocated
    to Highgate. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Harold Hunter Ward, who was born in the latter part of the nineteenth century, was
    an active Freemason and member of Elstree Lodge No.3092 in which he served as Master
    in 1911 and 1926. When the Home moved out of Radlett, Ward purchased the three properties.
    A private road, named The Rosewalk, was established between the two nearer to Cobden
    Hill, and these were developed into two detached houses becoming No.1 and No.2 The
    Rosewalk. and No.3,&nbsp;situated behind No.1 became the home to a number of Lodges, including
    Elstree Lodge. Thus, thanks to Ward&#39;s foresight, a Masonic meeting place was established
    in Radlett; the first recorded activity being the consecration of Elstree Chapter
    on the 25</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">th</span><span class="Normal-C"> July 1925. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Following Ward&#39;s death in 1940, one of the houses and No.3 was purchsed by Donald
    Forrester, another enthusiastic Freemason and noted philanthropist. In 1959, Forrester
    accepted an offer from the resident Lodges, contributing half of the value himself,
    and the the Masonic Hall (Radlett) Limited company to purchase No.3. Forrester died
    in 1985 when his generosity was further displaye by bequeathing &#163;300,000 to the Hertfordshire
    Old Peoples&#39; Establishment as well as other notable bequests. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">On the 24</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">th</span><span class="Normal-C"> June, 1717, four London based Lodges met at the Goose &amp; Gridiron Ale
    House in St&nbsp;Paul&#39;s Yard and formed the first ever Grand Lodge, electing Anthony Sayer
    as the first ever Grand Master and so began the formal regularisation of Freemasonry.
    On Sunday 25</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">th</span><span class="Normal-C"> June, 2017, as part of the Tercentenary Celebrations, the Masonic
    Hall organised an event entitled &#39;BEHIND CLOSED DOORS&#39; where members of the general
    public and Freemasons were invited in to view the building. The event was very well
    attended with xx Masonic and xx non-<wbr>Masonic visitors.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The Masonic Hall (Radlett) Limited continues to manage the centre to this day through
    a Board of volunteer Governors. Over the years, the building has been extended and
    improved a number of times and it now serves over 50 different Lodges and other Masonic
    units. In&nbsp;addition to the main Temple which is used for regular meetings and ceremonies,
    there are four rehearsal rooms, a boardroom, lounge bar, and a modern kitchen provides
    restaurant quality meals with a dining room which comfortably seats up to 70 diners.
    The bar and dining facilities are availbe for hire for private functions -<wbr> details
