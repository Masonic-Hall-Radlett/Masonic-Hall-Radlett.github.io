<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C">About Us</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The <a class="hlink_1" href="http://www.childrenshomes.org.uk/RadlettFTBA/"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link to childrenshomes.org.uk">Furniture Trades Provident and Benevolent Association</a> (later renamed the Furniture
    Trades Benevolent Association) was formed in 1903. Shortly after its formation, it
    established a Cottage Village and Orphanage at Cobden Hill, Radlett, Hertfordshire
    to &#39;</span><span class="Normal-C-C0">maintain and educate the orphan and necessitous children</span><span class="Normal-C">&#39; of its members. The
    establishment was officially opened on 22nd July, 1905, by the Association&#39;s President,
    <a class="hlink_1" href="http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Samuel_James_Waring"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link to Grace's Guide to British Industrial History">Samuel James Waring</a>, who later to become the 1st Baron Waring, and it comprised of
    two, late 19th century, semi-<wbr>detached houses. By 1918, a third house had been built
    but in 1921 the Association relocated to premises in Highgate, London. </span></p>
</div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:205px;top:725px;width:871px;height:575px;overflow:hidden;">
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Harold Hunter Ward was a Scottish Freemason residing at The Poplars, Elstree who,
    in 1905 and at the age of 39, joined Elstree Lodge No.3092 from <a class="hlink_1" href="https://scotlandsmasoniclodges.com/lodges/view/332/St.+Vincent%2C+Sandyford+"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">St. Vincent, Sandyford
    Lodge No.553 SC</a>. He&nbsp;served as Elstree Lodge&#39;s Master in 1911 and was appointed to
    Provincial Grand Treasurer for the year 1916-<wbr>17, although he most probably would
    not have looked after the accounts as this was an annual appointment in those days.
    Ward was a Founder Member of the Hertfordshire Masters Lodge No.4090 consecrated
    on 19th&nbsp;May, 1920, and he joined Motherland Lodge No. 3861 in London in 1921. After&nbsp;the
    Orphanage had relocated to Highgate, Ward purchased the three properties at Cobden
    Hill, the aforementioned third house becoming the Masonic Hall. In 1924, Ward joined
    Watford Chapter No.404 from <a class="hlink_1" href="http://www.pgracglasgow.com/chapters.htm"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">St. Andrew of Glasgow Chapter No.69 SC</a>, and was a Founder
    Member of the Elstree Chapter No.3092 consecrated on 25th&nbsp;May, 1925; the first recorded
    activity at the Hall. Later in 1926, Elstree Lodge No.3092 relocated from the Red
    Lion Hotel, Radlett. Thus, thanks to Ward&#39;s foresight, a Masonic meeting place was
    firmly established in Radlett. The next and third Masonic Unit to start meeting at
    the Masonic Hall wasn&#39;t until the consecration of Barham Lodge No.6004 on 11th December,
    1944. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">At some point between 1920 and 1938, an unadopted road, The Rose Walk, was established
    between the two houses nearer to Cobden Hill, and these became No.1 and No.2 The
    Rose Walk, with the Masonic Hall becoming No.3. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Ward received further recognition of his services to Freemasonry in 1934 with his
    appointed to Past Grand Standard Bearer in Grand Lodge; and in the Royal Arch, Ward
    was apppointed to Past Provincial Third Grand Principle and to Past Assistant Grand
    Director of Ceremonies in Supreme Grand Chapter in 1939. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not known if Ward
    was active in any other Masonic Order. </span></p>
</div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:205px;top:1665px;width:870px;height:1195px;overflow:hidden;">
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Ward died on 10th April 1946, afterwhich, one of the houses and the Hall was purchased
    by Donald Forrester, who, at the age of 33, had been Initiated into Elstree Lodge
    No.3092 on 16th June, 1938, served as Master in 1945, and in that same year, was
    Exalted into the resident, Elstree Chapter No.3092. Forrester was a Founding Member
    of the aforementioned Barham Lodge No.6004, and Member of five other Lodges and two
    further Chapters, including the resident Caishowe Chapter No.7536 of which he was
    also a Founding Member in May 1960. Forrester was appointed Provincial Junior Grand
    Warden in 1953, Assistant Provincial Grand Master from 1965 to 1974 and Deputy Provincial
    Grand Master from 1975 to 1985. In Grand Lodge, Forrester was appointed to Assistant
    Grand Director Ceremonies in 1934, Past Junior Grand Deacon in 1967, and Past Grand
    Sword Bearer in 1975. In&nbsp;1939, Forrester was recognised in the Royal Arch being appointed
    to Provincial Grand Scribe Nehemiah and to Past Grand Standard Bearer in Supreme
    Grand Chapter. It is not known if Forrester was active in any other Masonic Order.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">By the end of 1958, two further Lodges had been consecrated and started to meet at
    the Hall, and the members of the then four resident Lodges (Elstree, Barham, Radlett
    and Caishowe) and Elstree Chapter, formed the Masonic Hall (Radlett) Limited Company
    to purchase the Hall from Forrester, who contributed half of the value himself; although
    this is the subject of another story! Forrester was also known for his philanthropy
    and following his death, &nbsp;25th February,1985, his wife Gwyneth established the <a class="hlink_1" href="http://forrestertrusts.com/donald-forrester-trust/"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link to Donald Forrester Trust">Donald
    Forrester Trust</a> in 1986. The <a class="hlink_1" href="http://forrestertrusts.com/donald-forrester-trust/"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link to Gwyneth Forrester Trust">Gwyneth Forrester Trust</a>, was later established in 2000
    following her death in 1999. The&nbsp;Forrester Trusts continue to this day and each aims
    donate somewhere in the region of &#163;500K per year to many good causes, including a
    regular donation to the <a class="hlink_1" href="http://www.pmkcfriends.co.uk"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link to The Phoenixmasonry Masonic Museum and Library">Association of Friends of Prince Michael of Kent Court</a>, who
    support the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution Home in Watford. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Harold Ward&#39;s name appears on a board, outside and above the double doors at the
    end of the Dining Room, and a framed photograph of Ward clothed in his Provisional
    Grand Treasurer regalia hangs in the Boardroom which is also named in his honour.
    Donald Forrester&#39;s portrait hangs inside and above the same set of double doors at
    the end of the Dining Room, and is the only portrait of a Deputy Provincial Grand
    Master known to be hanging in a Masonic centre in Hertfordshire.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The Masonic Hall (Radlett) Limited continues to manage the centre to this day through
    a Board of volunteer Governors. Over the years, the building has been extended and
    improved, and now hosts around 25 Craft Lodges and 30 other Units from the appended
    Orders who meet throughout the year on regular bases. In addition to the main Temple
    which is used for regular meetings, ceremonies and rehearsals, there are also four
    rehearsal rooms, a boardroom for committee meetings, a lounge bar, kitchen, and a
    dining room which comfortably seats up to 70 diners. The bar and dining facilities
    are available for hire for private functions. -<wbr> further details can be found by clicking

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">On the 24th day of June, which celebrates the birthday of St John the Baptist, in
    1717 four London based Lodges met at the <a class="hlink_1" href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/goose_and_gridiron_ale-house.htm"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link to The Phoenixmasonry Masonic Museum and Library">Goose &amp; Gridiron Ale House</a> in St&nbsp;Paul&#39;s
    Yard to form the world&#39;s first ever Grand Lodge, electing Anthony Sayer as the first
    Grand Master; and so began the formal regularisation of Freemasonry. On Sunday&nbsp;25th
    June, 2017, as part of the Tercentenary Celebrations, the Masonic Hall hosted an
    event entitled &#39;BEHIND CLOSED DOORS&#39; where members of the general public were invited
    into the Hall and were given a guided tour of the building and an appreciation on
    the history of Freemasonry. The Governors extend their appreciation to all those
    who assisted in general, and to the many visitors that attended in particular.</span></p>
