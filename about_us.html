<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C">About Us</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The <a href="http://www.childrenshomes.org.uk/RadlettFTBA/"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;">Furniture Trades Provident and Benevolent Association</a> (later renamed the Furniture
    Trades Benevolent Association) was formed in 1903. Shortly after its formation, it
    established a Cottage Village and Orphanage at Cobden Hill, Radlett, Hertfordshire
    to &#39;</span><span class="Normal-C-C0">maintain and educate the orphan and necessitous children</span><span class="Normal-C">&#39; of its members. The
    establishment was officially opened on 22</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">nd</span><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;July, 1905, by the Association&#39;s President,
    <a href="http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Samuel_James_Waring"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;" title="Link to Grace's Guide to British Industrial History">Samuel James Waring</a>, who later to become the 1</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">st</span><span class="Normal-C"> Baron Waring, and it comprised of
    two semi-<wbr>detached houses. By 1918, a third house had been built but in 1921 the Association
    relocated to premises in Highgate, London. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Harold Hunter Ward, who was born in the latter part of the nineteenth century, was
    an active Freemason and member of Elstree Lodge No.3092 in which he served as Master
    in 1911 and 1926. When the Association relocated to Highgate, Ward purchased the
    three properties. A&nbsp;private road, named The Rosewalk, was established between the
    two houses nearer to Cobden Hill, and these were converted into two detached houses
    which became No.1 and No.2 The&nbsp;Rosewalk. The third house, situated behind No.1, became
    No.3 The Rosewalk and eventually home to a number of Lodges, including Elstree Lodge.
    Thus, thanks to Ward&#39;s foresight, a Masonic meeting place was established in Radlett;
    the first recorded activity being the consecration of Elstree Chapter on the 25</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">th</span><span class="Normal-C">
    July, 1925. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Following Ward&#39;s death in 1940, one of the houses and No.3 was purchsed by Donald
    Forrester, another enthusiastic Freemason and noted philanthropist. In 1959, Forrester
    accepted an offer from the resident Lodges, contributing half of the value himself,
    and the the Masonic Hall (Radlett) Limited company was formed to purchase No.3. Forrester
    died in 1985 when his generosity was further displayed by bequeathing &#163;300,000 to
    the Hertfordshire Old Peoples&#39; Establishment as well as other notable bequests. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">On the 24</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">th</span><span class="Normal-C"> June, 1717, four London based Lodges met at the <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/goose_and_gridiron_ale-house.htm"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;">Goose &amp; Gridiron Ale
    House</a> in St&nbsp;Paul&#39;s Yard and formed the first ever Grand Lodge, electing Anthony Sayer
    as the first ever Grand Master and so began the formal regularisation of Freemasonry.
    As part of the Tercentenary Celebrations, the Masonic Hall organised an event entitled
    &#39;BEHIND CLOSED DOORS&#39; on Sunday 25</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">th</span><span class="Normal-C"> June, 2017, where members of the general public
    and Freemasons were invited to view the building. The event was very well attended
    with xx Masonic and xx non-<wbr>Masonic visitors.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The Masonic Hall (Radlett) Limited continues to manage the centre to this day through
    a Board of volunteer Governors. Over the years, the building has been extended and
    improved and it now serves over 50 different Lodges and other Masonic units. In&nbsp;addition
    to the main Temple which is used for regular meetings and ceremonies, there are four
    rehearsal rooms, a boardroom, lounge bar, and a modern kitchen provides restaurant
    quality meals with a dining room which comfortably seats up to 70 diners. The bar
