<p class="Normal-P-P0"><span class="Normal-C-C1">The <a class="hlink_1" href="http://www.childrenshomes.org.uk/RadlettFTBA/"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">Furniture Trades Provident and Benevolent Association</a> (later renamed the Furniture
    Trades Benevolent Association) was formed in 1903. Shortly after its formation, it
    established a Cottage Village and Orphanage at Cobden Hill, Radlett, Hertfordshire
    to &#39;</span><span class="Normal-C-C2">maintain and educate the orphan and necessitous children</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">&#39; of its members. The
    establishment was officially opened on 22</span><span class="Normal-C-C3">nd</span><span class="Normal-C-C1">&nbsp;July, 1905, by the Association&#39;s President,
    <a class="hlink_1" href="http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Samuel_James_Waring"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link to Grace's Guide to British Industrial History">Samuel James Waring</a>, who later to become the 1</span><span class="Normal-C-C3">st</span><span class="Normal-C-C1"> Baron Waring, and it comprised of
    two semi-<wbr>detached houses. By 1918, a third house had been built but in 1921 the Association
    relocated to premises in Highgate, London. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P-P0"><span class="Normal-C-C1">Harold Hunter Ward, who was born in the latter part of the nineteenth century and
    who had moved to Radlett, was an active Freemason being a member of Watford Lodge
    No.404 and Watford Chapter No.404. He was a joining member of Elstree Lodge No.3092
    becoming Master in 1911 and 1926, he was appoitned to Provincial Grand Treasurer
    for 1916-<wbr>17, he was a founding member of the Hertfordshier Master&#39;s Lodge No.4090
    in 1920 and of Elstree Chapter No.3092 in 1925, and he was appointed to Past Grand
    Standard Bearer in 1934. When the Association moved out of Radlett in the early 1920&#39;s,
    Ward purchased the three properties. A private road, named The Rosewalk, was established
    between the two houses nearer to Cobden Hill, and these were converted into two detached
    houses which became No.1 and No.2 The Rosewalk. The third house, situated behind
    No.1, became No.3 The Rosewalk and eventually home to a number of Lodges, including
    Elstree Lodge. Thus, thanks to Ward&#39;s foresight, a Masonic meeting place was established
    in Radlett; the first recorded activity being the consecration of Elstree Chapter
    on the 25th July, 1925. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P-P0"><span class="Normal-C-C1">Ward died in the mid 1940&#39;s, afterwhich No.3 and the houses were purchsed by Donald
    Forrester, another enthusiastic and notable Freemason and philanthropist. Forrester
    was a member of Barham Lodge No.6004, becoming Master in 19??, and a joining member
    of Elstree Lodge No.3092. In 1959, the resident Units (Elstree, Radlett, Barham,
    and Caishowe Lodges and Elstree Chapter) formed the Masonic Hall (Radlett) Limited
    company and acquired the freehold to No.3 from Forrester, who generously contributied
    half of the cost, although this is the subject of another story! Forrester died in
    1985, after which his wife Gwyneth established the <a class="hlink_2" href="http://forrestertrusts.com/donald-forrester-trust/"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">Donald Forrester Trust</a> 1986, a
    second charity, the <a class="hlink_2" href="http://forrestertrusts.com/donald-forrester-trust/"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">Gwyneth Forrester Trust</a>, being established in 2000 following
    her death in 1999. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P-P0"><span class="Normal-C-C1">Harold H. Ward&#39;s name appears on a board, outside and above the double doors at the
    end of the Dining Room, and a framed photograph of Ward clothed in his Provisional
    Grand Treasrer regalia hangs in the Boardroom which is also named in his honour.
    Donald Forrester&#39;s portrait hangs inside and above the double doors at the end of
    the Dining Room, and is the only portrait of a Deputy Provincial Grand Master on
    display in a Masoinic centre. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P-P0"><span class="Normal-C-C1">On the 24th June, 1717, four London based Lodges met at the <a class="hlink_1" href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/goose_and_gridiron_ale-house.htm"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">Goose &amp; Gridiron Ale
    House</a> in St&nbsp;Paul&#39;s Yard and formed the world&#39;s first ever Grand Lodge, electing Anthony
    Sayer as the first Grand Master and so began the formal regularisation of Freemasonry.
    As part of the Tercentenary Celebrations, the Masonic Hall has organised an event
    entitled &#39;BEHIND CLOSED DOORS&#39; on Sunday&nbsp;25th June, 2017, where members of the general
    public and Freemasons are invited to view the building.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P-P0"><span class="Normal-C-C1">The Masonic Hall (Radlett) Limited continues to manage the centre to this day through
    a Board of volunteer Governors. Over the years, the building has been extended and
    improved and it now serves over 50 different Lodges and other Masonic units. In addition
    to the main Temple which is used for regular meetings and ceremonies, there are four
    rehearsal rooms, a boardroom, lounge bar, and a modern kitchen provides restaurant
    quality meals with a dining room which comfortably seats up to 70 diners. The bar
    and dining facilities are availbe for hire for private functions -<wbr> details can be
